    "**Aims of this tutorial**:\n",
    "- Introduce you Pytorch, a library made for working with neural networks.\n",
    "- Implement Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), starting from linear regression.\n",
    "- Implement a small Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).\n",
    "Along the way you will implement forward and back-propagation as well as stochastic gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may look long, but it should be easy to complete. Understanding and familiarizing yourselves with the core points of this tutorial and the Pytorch library is of **very high importance in order to be able to follow the next tutorials and Coursework \\#2**. Invest some time to study and understand it, and don't hesitate to ask if you don't understand something.\n",

For this, we need to derive the derivative of each of a network's component, and implement it. It can get extremely tedious for larger nets. Libraries build for Deep Learning (like Pytorch, Tensorflow, Theano, Chainer, etc), offer auto-differentiation: When the forward pass is implemented, the framework keeps track of the operations performed on the tensors. The backend has already implementations of each operation's derivative. To do the backprop, the library's back end will take care of applying the chain-rule automatically.\n",
